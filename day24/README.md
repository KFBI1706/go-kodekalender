# Day 24 - Merry Christmas!

Not much to say about this task. This was just a custom excel column format including nordic characters. To find the number we just use basic number system math to compute the value of the char based on it's position and add them together. I also think it's fitting that the line numbers added up to 24.

I'll write an abstract about the whole challenge later :)
