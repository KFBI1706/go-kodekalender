# Day 14 - cp day1{1,4}/main.go

I'll make this short and sweet, I have a lot to do today. So the title is just the first command I run and it pretty much sums up this task;
* Copy the code from day 11
* Make some slight modifications (take each individual step, track coordinates visited)
* ???
* Profit

Really that was everything, aside from some tired programming mistakes I was finished in record time. With a runtime of 7ms
