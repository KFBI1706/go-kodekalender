# Day 11 - Tired presumptions

This day started off with a message from a friend at 06:07 saying that he'd allready solved it..

Now that all my competitive nature was out of the window, I still had to solve the task, but as i turns out my brain wasn't set on the same thing.

For some reason, I'm guessing tiredness I assumed there were multiple packages, therefore multiple lines in the text file and that the instructions were ordered. All of these were wrong.

The input was just a single line of distances between 1-9 accompabined by a direction. Santa didn't even travel >9 one way before changing direction. I assumed he'd atleast do it sometimes and decided to account for that with a much slower solution.

All in all it was a fun task and after my brain had booted up it took me a total of 12 minutes to whip up this solution in go. So I'm quite happy.

What I've learned today is bascially, don't rush a task when you're tired, that'll often lead to more bad presumptions, compared to if you just wake up, then do the task.
