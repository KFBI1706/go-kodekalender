# Day 7 - A late one, but a good one

I have to admit, it's hard to keep track of when to release the solutions, anyways here it goes.

This task was really hard for some reason, combined with the fact that I didn't have a lot of time this day, it almost made me miss a day.

Then at around 5am, after sleeping and being done with all of my other tasks I looked at the task again, began google'ing, and suddenly!

Longest increasing subsequence! So in a hurry I mimicked the code on the Wikipedia page and submitted, correct answer!

I don't really know why I didn't find the solution when I was looking at it before, but this just goes to show the importance of sleep or at least taking breaks.
