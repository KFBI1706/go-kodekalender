# Day 3 - When you're to tired to see the `don't code & snore` signs

This was a really interesting and kind of math heavy challenge. 

It started with me beginning at the total wrong end trying to factor the numbers, which was completely wrong. 

Sooner or later I played with the prime numbers and realized that there couldn't be that many numbers if there has to be 24 of them and they have to be prime.

And lastly realizing that I could make it even faster with the fact that there can't be more than 13 3's, therefore there has to be 11 2's.

This seems like a straight forward path, but let me be the first to tell you, it was not..
I had several projects going where I was trying several really complicated solutions, also some really computationally heavy solutions.
Basically I was overthinking the task, and didn't realize the simplicity of it. 
I also had some problems with Go, as it's one of the first math tasks I've solved with go, I usually use python. But all in all this task was a really valuable learning experience.

Mostly this can be summed up as don't code while you're really tired or you'll start off on the total wrong path and just ride down it without ever realising that you're going the completely wrong way

Keeping all that in mind is's always nice being rewarded with 0.08 run-time :)
