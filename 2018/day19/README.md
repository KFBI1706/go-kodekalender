# Day 19 - Long traveled ham

So today I had an exam, followed by me travelling home for Christmas, I wanted to go home this year :)

Anyways as you can see by the commit time and bad attempts at being witty, I'm really tired. Therefore it fit well that todays task was really easy.

I knew of hamming distance before hand and just searched for an algorithm, found one in python, wrote it in Go. Bish bash bosh.. Done.

Not much else to say, I was impressed with how cleanly the python code could be translated into Go, with only the convenience function min requiring  some slice sorting on the Go end, but for the rest of the code I'd say it looks better than python. Major bias btw.
