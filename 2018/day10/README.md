# Day 10 - Is this Java?

Today I feel like I've written a huge script for something that could be done in much fewer lines. I might catch a lot of flack for this, but I feel this is kind of like what an enterprise Java application often turns into.

Aside from my massive line-count it was still a really fun task, it was something new and refreshing compared to a lot of the other tasks.

What I've learned from this task is mostly that the function of the script should be evaluated, and the likelihood of it changing should decide if you write it in a maintainable or unmaintainable way.

I've also picked up on some new templates that I want to write, so maybe I can beat the fast python solutions, while still writing it in a maintainable way.
