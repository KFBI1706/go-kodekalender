# Day 8 - breaking tunnelvision

There's not much to say about this task, there were only 60 dolls and two simple constrains; no matching colors and always decreasing doll sizes. Then we just had to find the longest list following these requirements.

Still having some PTSD from solving the day 7 task 1 hour before the time limit I thought this task was gonna be a repeat and I instantly started searching for advanced algorithms, I even got about 5 pages into a research paper.

Then suddenly, my tired mind decided just to "try" a much simpler solution. So I prototyped something in ten minutes, got an supposed answer, submitted it. And to my surprise... It worked!

I I also managed to create a quite readable and fast solution this time with a minimal amount of time, as well as breaking free from my initial tunnel vision.

So regardless of the code I'm very happy with my performance.
