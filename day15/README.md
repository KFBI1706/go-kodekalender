#Day 15 - That's it?

I'll make this short, I generate and store the square and original number pairwise in a slice. I extract the year from the string and look from 0 to 100 years ahead in time where I check that the square matches the year ofset with the age. And that the age matches the original num. That's it

Really easy task, and there's lots of optimizations to be done, I'll se if I've got the time later today.
